# ❤️ Heart Failure Risk Prediction and Cluster Analysis  

### 📊 **Project Overview:**  
This project leverages **machine learning and statistical analysis** to predict heart failure outcomes and segment patients into risk categories. By analyzing clinical data, the goal is to identify key features associated with mortality and provide actionable insights for **early intervention and patient management**.  

---

## 🔍 **Objectives:**  
- Predict heart failure mortality using **logistic regression**.  
- Segment patients into risk clusters using **KMeans clustering**.  
- Identify key clinical features contributing to heart failure outcomes.  
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, recall, F1-score, and Cohen’s Kappa**.  

---

## 🚀 **Key Features:**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualizations (pair plots, heatmaps) to explore relationships between variables.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Logistic Regression for mortality prediction.  
  - KMeans clustering to group patients by risk level.  
- **Statistical Testing:**  
  - Independent t-tests to identify significant differences between survivors and non-survivors.  
  - Cohen’s Kappa to measure agreement between cluster predictions and true labels.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Pair plots to visualize clustering across critical features.  
  - ROC Curve and confusion matrices for model evaluation.  

---

## 📊 **Results:**  
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 82%  
- **Recall for Mortality Cases (Class 1):** 85%  
- **Cohen’s Kappa (Cluster Agreement):** 0.44 (Moderate Agreement)  

---

## 📈 **Key Findings:**  
- **Serum Creatinine** and **Ejection Fraction** are strong predictors of heart failure mortality.  
- **Time (follow-up period)** correlates with patient survival, with shorter follow-up linked to higher mortality.  
- Cluster analysis reveals **two distinct patient groups**, representing high and low-risk categories.
